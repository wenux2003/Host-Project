# Order Email Notifications Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds automatic email notifications when customers place orders. The system sends two types of emails:

1. **Customer Confirmation Email**: Sent to the customer with order details and a thank-you message
2. **Manager Notification Email**: Sent to the order manager with order details for processing

## Features Implemented

### 1. Customer Confirmation Email
- **Recipient**: Customer's email address
- **Subject**: `ðŸŽ‰ Order Confirmation - {OrderID}`
- **Content**: 
  - Thank you message: "Your order was successful. Thank you for shopping with us."
  - Order details (ID, date, status, total amount, delivery address)
  - List of ordered items with quantities and prices
  - Next steps information
  - Professional HTML formatting

### 2. Manager Notification Email
- **Recipient**: Order manager (configured via `SERVICE_MANAGER_EMAIL` environment variable)
- **Subject**: `ðŸ“¦ New Order Received - {OrderID}`
- **Content**:
  - Order information (ID, date, status, amount, payment ID)
  - Customer information (name, email, phone, delivery address)
  - Detailed list of ordered items
  - Action items for the manager
  - Professional HTML formatting

## Integration Points

The email notifications are automatically triggered when orders are completed in the following scenarios:

### 1. Direct Order Creation (`createOrder`)
- **File**: `controllers/orderController.js`
- **Trigger**: When an order is created with `status: 'completed'`
- **Function**: `createOrder()`

### 2. Cart Order Completion (`completeCartOrder`)
- **File**: `controllers/orderController.js`
- **Trigger**: When a cart order is updated to completed status
- **Function**: `completeCartOrder()`

### 3. Payment Processing (`paySelectedCartItems`)
- **File**: `controllers/paymentController.js`
- **Trigger**: When cart items are paid for and converted to completed orders
- **Function**: `paySelectedCartItems()`

### 4. Manual Payment Processing (`processOrderPayment`)
- **File**: `controllers/paymentController.js`
- **Trigger**: When a manual payment is processed and order status is set to 'completed'
- **Function**: `processOrderPayment()`

### 5. Order Status Updates (`updateOrder`)
- **File**: `controllers/orderController.js`
- **Trigger**: When an order status is manually updated to 'completed'
- **Function**: `updateOrder()`

## Email Service Functions

### New Functions Added to `utils/wemailService.js`:

1. **`sendOrderConfirmationEmail(order, customer)`**
   - Sends confirmation email to customer
   - Returns boolean indicating success/failure
   - Includes comprehensive order details

2. **`sendOrderManagerNotificationEmail(order, customer)`**
   - Sends notification email to order manager
   - Returns boolean indicating success/failure
   - Includes actionable information for order processing

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables must be configured:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
SERVICE_MANAGER_EMAIL=manager@yourcompany.com
```

### Email Service Setup
- Uses Gmail SMTP (smtp.gmail.com:465)
- Requires Gmail App Password for authentication
- Supports HTML email formatting

## Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: If email sending fails, the order processing continues normally
- **Logging**: All email operations are logged with success/failure status
- **Error Isolation**: Email failures don't affect order creation or payment processing
- **Customer Email Validation**: Checks for valid customer email before sending

## Testing

A test script is provided (`test-order-emails.js`) to verify email functionality:

```bash
node test-order-emails.js
```

## Implementation Details

### Email Templates
- **Responsive HTML Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent with CricketExpert branding
- **Clear Information Hierarchy**: Easy to read and understand
- **Action-Oriented Content**: Provides clear next steps

### Data Population
- Orders are populated with customer and product details before sending emails
- Handles missing data gracefully with fallback values
- Includes comprehensive order item information

### Performance Considerations
- Email sending is asynchronous and doesn't block order processing
- Uses existing email infrastructure (nodemailer)
- Minimal impact on order processing performance

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Triggering
Emails are sent automatically when:
- Customer completes a purchase through the frontend
- Admin processes a payment manually
- Order status is updated to 'completed'

### Manual Testing
```javascript
import { sendOrderConfirmationEmail, sendOrderManagerNotificationEmail } from './utils/wemailService.js';

// Test with mock data
await sendOrderConfirmationEmail(mockOrder, mockCustomer);
await sendOrderManagerNotificationEmail(mockOrder, mockCustomer);
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Email templates can be customized in `utils/wemailService.js`
- Manager email address can be changed via environment variable
- Email content can be modified without affecting order processing logic
- All email operations are logged for debugging and monitoring

## Security Considerations

- Email credentials are stored in environment variables
- No sensitive payment information is included in emails
- Customer data is handled according to privacy requirements
- Email addresses are validated before sending

This implementation ensures that both customers and order managers are promptly notified when orders are placed, improving the overall customer experience and operational efficiency.
